    <h2>Course of play:</h2>
    <p>In the gameplay, the goal is to complete the scenario and at the same time score as many points as possible.</p>
    <p>In multiplayer, we randomly designate the first player, then take the next player's turn clockwise (no more first
        player designations).</p>
    <p> At the beginning of the game, each player chooses a starting point on which to place their character marker - it
        can be any empty field on the map (or chosen by the scenario).</p>
    <p> Each turn begins with a roll of 4 D6 dice which constitute the player's action pool.<br>
        Using them they can perform various <strong>actions</strong>:

    <ul>
        <li><strong>move</strong>:<br>it costs 1 die point to move each field. This means that for a die value of 5 you
            can move 5 fields. You can use any number of dice to move or not move at all. Making a move means moving the
            meeple to a new field (we do not draw anything on the map during a move, we can move on the same fields many
            times).<br>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/move_expl.gif"><br>
            Palm fields are an obstacle that you always you have to go around. You can't go through them nor can't stop
            there.<br>
            <br>
            You can use any amount of dice per turn to move.<br>
            <br>
            You do not have to use all the movement points you you get from the dice. You may stop earlier on the field
            on which you want to perform the action (e.g. move 2 fields using dice with a value of 6). However, this
            means the player ends their move and loses any remaining points on the die that was used to move.
        </li>
    </ul>
