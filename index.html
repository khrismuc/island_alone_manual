        <p>In the gameplay, the goal is to complete the scenario and at the same time score as many points as possible.
        </p>
        <p>In multiplayer, we randomly designate the first player, then take the next player's turn clockwise (no more
            first
            player designations).</p>
        <p> At the beginning of the game, each player chooses a starting point on which to place their character marker
            - it
            can be any empty field on the map (or chosen by the scenario).</p>
        <p> Each turn begins with a roll of 4 D6 dice which constitute the player's action pool.<br>
            Using them they can perform various <strong>actions</strong>:

        <ul id="actions">
            <li id="move">
                <h3>Move:</h3>
                It costs 1 die point to move each field. This means that for a die value of 5 you
                can move 5 fields. You can use any number of dice to move or not move at all. Making a move means moving
                the
                meeple to a new field (we do not draw anything on the map during a move, we can move on the same fields
                many
                times).<br>
                <br>

                            Palm fields are an obstacle that you always you have to go around. You can't go through them
                            nor
                            can't stop
                            there.

                <br>
                You can use any amount of dice per turn to move.<br>
                <br>
                You do not have to use all the movement points you get from the dice. You may stop earlier on the field
                on which you want to perform the action (e.g. move 2 fields using dice with a value of 6). However, this
                means the player ends their move and loses any remaining points on the die that was used to move.

                To get an item we have to enter its field and spend one die of any value. Then cross the item off the

                In the same manner we can also collect food and water which we also mark in the appropriate places water
                and
                food resources (and we cross out those collected on the map)<br>
                Collecting 1 food resource gives 1 resource point. (In various scenarios, different types of food will
                appear, hence the different symbols.)<br>

                            If we use a die with this value we will get a '<a href="#survivalpoints"><strong>survival

                            Precious crystals can be found on the island. After returning to civilization they can
                            provide
                            you with wealth, it is worth collecting them.<br>
                            <br>
                            The crystal is collected in the same way as resources, you enter its field and sacrifice a
                            die
                            of any value. Then cross the crystal off the map and circle the crystal you've gained in
                            your
                            own crystal field. We start marking the crystals on the left side of the map - each new
                            crystal
                            gives more points (all are counted separately at the end of the game)<br>
                            In a multiplayer game, each player counts their own crystals (i.e. crosses off one by one,
                            if
                            the other player got 2 it doesn't mean that another will get the straight third one for 10

                            In certain places on the island we can make smoke signs with a campfire. This way we
                            increase
                            our chances of being rescued.<br>

                            When you enter any of the smoke marks on the map, sacrifice any die and enter its value into
                            the
                            free smoke mark field (also cross it out on the map). (To be able to perform this action,
                            you
                            must have the item: campfire!)
                            <br>Now in order to perform this action elsewhere you will have to use exactly the same dice
                            value as you used the first time. After performing 4 the player will receive 25 points at
                            the
                            end of the game.<br>
                            In a multi-player game 25 points are awarded to the player who has the most smoke marks
                            provided
                            that at least 4 have been made in total. In the event of a tie, each player who participated
                            gets 5 points.

                            The mask is collected in the same way as resources - you enter the field with the mask and

                            each
