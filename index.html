    <p>The object of the game is to complete the scenario objectives, scoring as many points as possible.</p>
    <h2 id="preparation">Game preparation:</h2>
    <p>To play we need:<br>
        1 player: solo game sheet, pencil or pen, 4 D6 dice, character marker (meeple preferred), scenario card<br>
        2-4 players: a character sheet for each player, a common map card for all players, 4 D6 dice, a pen or pencil
        for each player, character markers for each player (preferably different colored meeples), scenario card</p>

    <h2 id="gameplay">Course of play:</h2>
    <p>In the gameplay, the goal is to complete the scenario and at the same time score as many points as possible.</p>
    <p>In multiplayer, we randomly designate the first player, then take the next player's turn clockwise (no more first
        player designations).</p>
    <p> At the beginning of the game, each player chooses a starting point on which to place their character marker - it
        can be any empty field on the map (or chosen by the scenario).</p>
    <p> Each turn begins with a roll of 4 D6 dice which constitute the player's action pool.<br>
        Using them they can perform various <strong>actions</strong>:

    <ul>
        <li><strong>move</strong>:<br>
            it costs 1 die point to move each field. This means that for a die value of 5 you
            can move 5 fields. You can use any number of dice to move or not move at all. Making a move means moving the
            meeple to a new field (we do not draw anything on the map during a move, we can move on the same fields many
            times).<br>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/move_expl.gif"><br>
            Palm fields are an obstacle that you always you have to go around. You can't go through them nor can't stop
            there.<br>
            <br>
            You can use any amount of dice per turn to move.<br>
            <br>
            You do not have to use all the movement points you get from the dice. You may stop earlier on the field
            on which you want to perform the action (e.g. move 2 fields using dice with a value of 6). However, this
            means the player ends their move and loses any remaining points on the die that was used to move.
        </li>
        <li><strong>collect resources:</strong><br>
            there are 3 resources needed to create items in the game.<br>
            To get an item we have to enter its field and spend one die of any value. Then cross the item off the map
            and mark it in your inventory.<br>
            <br>
            <div class="steps">
                <div>
                    <img src="./images/collecting_resources_1.png">
                    <span>We stop at the field of the resource that we want to get.</span>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="./images/any_die.png">
                    <span>We pay the cost of any one die and cross out the resource from the map.</span>

                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            In the same manner we can also collect food and water which we also mark in the appropriate places water and
            food resources (and we cross out those collected on the map)<br>
            Collecting 1 food resource gives 1 resource point. (In various scenarios, different types of food will
            appear, hence the different symbols.)<br>
            <br>

                    <span>Resources and food/water can be captured with any die, but each field of this type is also
                        marked with a die value.<br>
                        If we use a die with this value we will get a '<strong>survival point</strong>'.</span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Survival points:</h2>

    <p>If you get a survival point, you do not have to use it right away. You can mark it with a vertical line on the
        survival points track on your board and use it later (also several at once during one turn).<br>
        Each captured and not used survival point gives 1 point at the end of the game.</p>
    <p>
        By using it we can:
