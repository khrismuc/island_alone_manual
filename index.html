        <p>In the gameplay, the goal is to complete the scenario and at the same time score as many points as possible.
        </p>
        <p>In multiplayer, we randomly designate the first player, then take the next player's turn clockwise (no more
            first player designations).</p>
        <p> At the beginning of the game, each player chooses a starting point on which to place their character marker
            - it can be any empty field on the map (or chosen by the scenario).</p>
        <p> Each turn begins with a roll of 4 D6 dice which constitute the player's action pool.<br>
            Using them they can perform various <strong>actions</strong>:

        <ul id="actions">
            <li id="move">
                <h3>Move:</h3>
                It costs 1 die point to move each field. This means that for a die value of 5 you
                can move 5 fields. You can use any number of dice to move or not move at all. Making a move means moving
                the meeple to a new field (we do not draw anything on the map during a move, we can move on the same
                fields many times).<br>
                <br>
                <div class="steps">
                    <div>
                        <img src="./images/move_expl.png" alt="moving anywhere except palmtree fields">
                        <span>
                            Palm fields are an obstacle that you always you have to go around. You can't go through them
                            nor can't stop there.
                        </span>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br>
                You can use any amount of dice per turn to move.<br>
                <br>
                You do not have to use all the movement points you get from the dice. You may stop earlier on the field
                on which you want to perform the action (e.g. move 2 fields using dice with a value of 6). However, this
                means the player ends their move and loses any remaining points on the die that was used to move.

                To get an item we have to enter its field and spend one die of any value. Then cross the item off the
                map and mark it in your inventory.<br>
                <br>

                In the same manner we can also collect food and water which we also mark in the appropriate places water
                and food resources (and we cross out those collected on the map)<br>
                Collecting 1 food resource gives 1 resource point. (In various scenarios, different types of food will
                appear, hence the different symbols.)<br>

                            marked with a die value.<br>
                            If we use a die with this value we will get a '<a href="#survivalpoints"><strong>survival

                            Precious crystals can be found on the island. After returning to civilization they can
                            provide you with wealth, it is worth collecting them.<br>
                            <br>
                            The crystal is collected in the same way as resources, you enter its field and sacrifice a
                            die of any value. Then cross the crystal off the map and circle the crystal you've gained in
                            your own crystal field. We start marking the crystals on the left side of the map - each new
                            crystal gives more points (all are counted separately at the end of the game)<br>
                            <br>
                            In a multiplayer game, each player counts their own crystals (i.e. crosses off one by one,
                            if the other player got 2 it doesn't mean that another will get the straight third one for
                            10 points)

                            In certain places on the island we can make smoke signs with a campfire. This way we
                            increase our chances of being rescued.<br>
                            <br>
                            When you enter any of the smoke marks on the map, sacrifice any die and enter its value into
                            the free smoke mark field (also cross it out on the map). (To be able to perform this
                            action, you must have the item: campfire!)
                            <br>Now in order to perform this action elsewhere you will have to use exactly the same dice
                            value as you used the first time. After performing 4 the player will receive 25 points at
                            the end of the game.<br>

                            In a multi-player game 25 points are awarded to the player who has the most smoke marks
                            provided that at least 4 have been made in total. In the event of a tie, each player who
                            participated gets 5 points.

                            <br>
                            The mask is collected in the same way as resources - you enter the field with the mask and

                            The mask is plotted on the map on the on the field of collected masks, marking each
                            successive mask with a circle.<br>
                            Each mask that we have collected can be used once - it allows us to change the value of any
                            die to any chosen one. Only after using the mask we remove its points. For
                            each captured but not used mask we get 5 points at the end of the game. Used masks do not
                            give any points.

        <h2 id="meetings">Player meetings</h2>
        <p>In multiplayer, players who are on adjacent fields can interact with each other:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>trade: players can trade or donate any resources (food, water, resources).</li>
            <li>fight: when a fight takes place, the attacker chooses a maximum of 2 weapons to use (which they have
                previously created). Then he rolls 4 D6 dice. In this way he determines the sum of his attack points.
                Each value equal to the value of the dice used to creating an item means one attack point (a maximum of
                4). Then the attacked player takes the same action and creates his attack point pool - if he has no
                weapon he creates points for each pair of dice (so he can have maximum 2 points). This method can only
                be used if the player has no weapons (if they have any they automatically use it).<br>
                <br>
                Combat is not counted as a turn's action (you don't have to pay for it with action points from the dice)
                but it ends the attacking player's turn (even if he still had dice to use).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If a player has a bow he can also attack a player one field away from him in a straight
                line (see below).</strong></p>

        <h3>How to fight</h3>
        <p>These 4 items can be used as weapons:</p>
        <div class="steps">

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The player who lost the battle loses 1 health point. In case of a tie, no one takes damage.</p>
        <p><strong>You cannot use combat to kill another player! If he has only 1 health point, he loses 1 resource of
                his choice.<br>
                <br>
                If he doesn't have any, he can't can be attacked or attack others!</strong></p>

        <h3>Attacking with the bow</h3>
        <img src="./images/attack_with_bow.png" alt="attacking a distant player with a bow">
        <p>When attacking with a bow, there must be no obstacle between players and can only be attacked on fields
            connected in a straight line by hex border).</p>
        <p>This attack proceeds in the same way (attacker rolls 4 D6 and for every 3 and 6 he has an attack point) but
            defending player:<br>
            -fights back if he also has a bow (he also rolls 4 D6 and the one who has more attack points deals
            damage).<br>
            -if he does not have a bow, he performs the stealth action according to the same rules as unarmed
            combat (roll 4 D6 and each pair is a point, maximum 2) but if he wins, he doesn't deal damage, he just
            avoids it (this also occurs when the attacker does not have any attack points).</p>

        <p class="important">During combat, you cannot use survival points to manipulate dice results, only to roll
            again!<br>
            You can use 1 (only 1) mask to change the value per fight.</p>

        <h2 id="endgame">End of game</h2>

        <p>The game ends after the number of turns specified in the scenario, when all players die, or after the
            scenario is completed (or failed).<br>
            <br>
            We count all the points scored and the player with the highest total wins (in case of a solo game save the
            score and try to beat it in the next games comparing also with 'glory list' for the given map/scenario).<br>
            <br>
            Points are counted for all earned â­ (counted multiple times for multiple campfires and tents).
